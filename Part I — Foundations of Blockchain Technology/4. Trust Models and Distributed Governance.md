# **4\. Trust Models and Distributed Governance**

### 4.1 Principles of Decentralized Systems

- Distributed consistency
- Byzantine environments
- Public vs permissioned participation

### 4.2 Consensus Mechanisms

- PoW mining
- PoS validation
- BFT-based consensus (PBFT, Tendermint, HotStuff)
- Liveness, safety, and resilience

### 4.3 System Robustness and Performance

- Scalability constraints
- Resilience under partitioning
- Defense against common attack vectors

### 4.4 Forks, Divergence, and Governance

- Soft vs hard forks
- Coordinated upgrades
- Governance models (on-chain vs off-chain)

### **4.5 Economic and Game-Theoretic Incentives**

- Rational actors and adversarial assumptions
- Incentive compatibility in decentralized systems
